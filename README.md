# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions: Change Payment Information Through Approval Workflow
This repository contains the sample code for the [Change Payment Information Through Approval Workflow tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-approve-payment-data).

*This code is only one part of the tutorial, so please follow the tutorial before attempting to use this code.*

## Description
Payment information of business partners is used for automated payment runs at the end of each month. Since payouts are fully automated, they could be vulnerable to fraud by changing a business partner’s bank information to a different bank account. In the [Change Payment Information Through Approval Workflow tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-approve-payment-data), a workflow application applies the four-eyes principle in the approval process for every payment data change to prevent any misuse. If users want to change a business partner’s payment information, they have to use the side-by-side application described in this guide.
